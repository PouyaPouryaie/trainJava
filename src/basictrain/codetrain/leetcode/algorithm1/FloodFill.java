/**
 * DFS/BFS
 * 733. Flood Fill
 * An image is represented by an m x n integer grid image where image[i][j] represents the pixel value of the image.
 * You are also given three integers sr, sc, and color. You should perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].
 * To perform a flood fill, consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with color.
 * Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.
 *
 * Input: image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 2
 * Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
 * Explanation: From the center of the image with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1) (i.e., the red pixel), all pixels connected by a path of the same color as the starting pixel (i.e., the blue pixels) are colored with the new color.
 * Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally connected to the starting pixel.
