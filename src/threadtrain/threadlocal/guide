when you do task in concurrency mode and you want avoid sync-blocking code.
you can use the threadLocal for memory-optimization and context.

1 - when you want use same-context per thread
for example you want per thread move between multi service and the thread use own data,
you should be use Thread-local to save data on specific context and use it into the another service.

2 - memory efficiency
for example you want, use one object per thread. so you init thread and create thread-local for it.
then every time you call thread, you use same object.

tips:
# - cleanUp once out of scope.
# - use local variable
# - if you use framework, delegate to framework. such as spring
